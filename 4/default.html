        A <span class="boldText">train</span> <span class="italicText">(from Old French trahiner, from Latin trahere, "to pull, to draw"[1])</span> is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight. 
        Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units. 
        Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. 
        Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. 
        Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.

        Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables. 
        <span class="boldText">Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1802,</span> trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. 
        Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
